# A Rokita Low Fidelity Prototype
## Introduction
I was first introduced to GIS as a wayward undergrad in 2017, and it’s been a runaway love story ever since. Being a geographer has enabled me to explore criminal justice, ecological changes, and much more. It’s about time for me to build an altar to my beloved in the form of a digital portfolio. 

While a resume tells hiring managers my background, a portfolio has the ability to show it. Recruiting Daily emphasizes that a portfolio “demonstrate[s] a candidate’s creativity, initiative, and attention to detail. They also provide a glimpse into a candidate’s personality and work style, which can be invaluable in determining whether they are a good fit for a given role and company culture,” (Castel, 2023). 

For this project, the objectives are:
To research effective GIS portfolios
And develop a flow fidelity prototype for my website-to-be.
